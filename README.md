# TicTacToe
My first programming project. 

This is a program which plays Tic-Tac-Toe/Three-in-a-row against the user. The user first creates an account with password and then choses game difficulty. In easy mode, the pieces are randomly placed where as in hard mode the peices are placed strategically. The users statistics (games played, win percentage) and tracked and stored. The user can later login using the same account and continue playing. There is also an option to change password or delete account. Its not much but its something!
